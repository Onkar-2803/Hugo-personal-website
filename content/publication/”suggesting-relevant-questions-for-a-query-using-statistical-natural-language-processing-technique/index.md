abstract: |
  Suggesting similar questions for a user query has
  many applications ranging from reducing search time of users
  on e-commerce websites, training of employees in companies to
  holistic learning for students. Use of Natural Language Processing
  techniques for suggesting similar questions is prevalent over the
  existing architecture. Mainly two approaches are studied for
  finding text similarity namely syntactic and semantic, however
  each has its draw-backs and fail to provide the desired outcome.
  In this article, a self-learning combined approach is proposed for
  determining textual similarity that introduces a robust weighted
  syntactic and semantic similarity index for determining similar
  questions from a predetermined database, this approach learns
  the optimal combination of the mentioned approaches for a
  database under consideration. Comprehensive analysis has been
  carried out to justify the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed
  approach over the existing literature.
